## Transfer Matrix Method
Utility functions for microcavity design using [tmm](https://github.com/sbyrnes321/tmm) to solve the transfer matrix 
equations. Cavity parameters can be given as a yaml, and the normal incidence reflection, angular dispersion, and field 
distribution inside the cavity can be easily and quickly calculated and plotted.

## Linear Schr√∂dinger solver
Direct diagonalisation solvers for polariton systems in one and two dimensions.

As a 1D example, you can get the farfield emission pattern from a harmonic well that modifies the photon component of the 
polariton:
```
from microcavities.simulation.linear.one_d.realspace import *
test_farfield_harmonic_potential()
```

As a 2D example, you can get the free-space dispersion relation from farfield emission of realspace wavefunctions and
compare it to analytical results (it'll take ~5min to run):
```
from microcavities.simulations.linear.polariton_realspace import *
test_hamiltonian_x()
```
