## Transfer Matrix Method
Utility functions for microcavity design using [tmm](https://github.com/sbyrnes321/tmm) to solve the transfer matrix 
equations. Cavity parameters can be given as a yaml, and the normal incidence reflection, angular dispersion, and field 
distribution inside the cavity can be easily and quickly calculated and plotted.
